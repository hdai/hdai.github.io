  <p><img src="blog/plots/5_steph_curry.png" alt="alt text"></p>
  <p><strong>Notes:</strong> 2011-12 was a shortened season due to the lockout and Curry was
      riddled with injuries, playing in only 26 out of the 66 games. 2015-16 was Curry's best
      making 402 three pointers (NBA record for most 3 pointers made). Second and third on the all-time
      most 3 pointers made in a season list are also held by Curry (324 in 2016-17 and 286 in 2014-15).
