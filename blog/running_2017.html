  <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I ran the most in the first 4 months of the year as I was
      training for my first marathon in May. I gradually increased my total KM every month until
      the big race and cut down my KM quite a bit to recover. Eventually, I lost my motivation
      to run as I did not sign up for any running events for the rest of the year.
