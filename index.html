          <h1 id="viz">Viz: Steph Curry three pointers made</h1>
            <p><img src="blog/plots/5_steph_curry.png" alt="alt text"></p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> 2011-12 was a shortened season due to the lockout and Curry was
                riddled with injuries, playing in only 26 out of the 66 games. 2015-16 was Curry's best
                making 402 three pointers (NBA record for most 3 pointers made). Second and third on the all-time
                most 3 pointers made in a season list are also held by Curry (324 in 2016-17 and 286 in 2014-15).

          <h1 id="viz">Viz: Personal running in 2017 </h1>
            <p><img src="blog/plots/4_running_2017.png" alt="alt text"></p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I ran the most in the first 4 months of the year as I was
                training for my first marathon in May. I gradually increased my total KM every month until
                the big race and cut down my KM quite a bit to recover. Eventually, I lost my motivation
                to run as I did not sign up for any running events for the rest of the year.

          <h1 id="viz">Viz: Shark attacks</h1>
            <p><img src="blog/plots/3_shark_attacks.png" alt="alt text"></p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Shark incidents peak in July in U.S. while peaks occur in
                  December/January in Australia and South Africa. This makes sense since these peaks
                  correspond to the summer months for each country.

          <h1 id="viz">Viz: U.S. college textbook prices</h1>
            <p><img src="blog/plots/2_textbook_prices.png" alt="alt text"></p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> I went to university in Canada between 2011 and 2016.

          <h1 id="viz">Viz: APPL vs. BBRY stock prices</h1>
            <p><img src="blog/plots/1_appl_bbry.png" alt="alt text"></p>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong> BBRY closing price actually peaked in May of 2008, roughly a year
              after the first iPhone was released (it was released in June of 2007).
